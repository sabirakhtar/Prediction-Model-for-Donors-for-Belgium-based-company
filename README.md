# Prediction-Model-for-Donors-for-Belgium-based-company
There is a Belgium-based organization that helps non-profit organizations finding donors for their good causes. They want to launch a new re-activation campaign where they want to send letters to those specific donors who have been inactive for a long time, with an objective/hoping that they will donate again. But the objective is to send out letters to donors who are more likely to donate more than 35 Euros. Therefore our objective is to  build a model to predict donors, who would donate more than 35 Euros in the reactivation campaign.
